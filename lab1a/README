LAB 1A 
For part A, we were required to read in a file and create a
command_stream struct. We first read in the file, parsed, and tokenized the file
one line at a time. Then, we placed the tokens on two different stacks: an
operations stack of enum command_types and a command stack or commands. Once
these stacks were implemented, making the command_stream just required popping
from the stacks and linking the commands together.

While parsing, we had to take into account syntactical errors that could carry
on to the next line.  In order to accomplish this, we kept track of the number
of parentheses, as well as special characters that may follow after a complete
command. Once an error was found, an error report with the line number and type
of error was printed out and the program exited.

There are three types of commands in the command_stream. A simple command is
just a command of words and redirections. A special command is formed by two
commands, and a subshell command points to another command.

At the end of each complete command, we would make a tree from the stacks and
returned a pointer to the first command. The command_stream is a linked lists of
Nodes that point to the top of each complete command. The make_command_stream
function returns the root Node that consists of the first complete command, and
the read_command_stream returns the first node of the command_stream, and
updates the new root to the next Node.

LAB 1B 
For part B, we were required to use our previous implementation from part A to
interpret commands and simulate the shell's behavior. We accomplished this with
an execution switch table that read the command type and acted appropriately.
Commands that involved the operations AND, OR, SEQUENTIAL, and SUBSHELL
simply called our base execution for a SIMPLE command and returned the
appropriate status afterwards. The PIPE command required a little more work in
its implementation using the fork() to create children to execute the pipe
commands. The parent had to wait on the child processes to finish executing. In
executing simple commands, we again forked a child that would use execvp() to
execute the simple commands and let the parent wait for it. This was necessary
because the execvp() method would not return if successful. We created a special
exeception if the command exec was passed as a simple command. Given this
command, we executed the command following exec as the main command and at
Tuan's request, instead of letting the exec terminate the process, we let it
continue processing further commands. We also used a helper function called
setupInOut in order to help in the input and output redirections in commands.
This utilized the dup2 function to copy file descriptors to stdin or stdout.

One thing to note for our lab, for some reason, our make check stopped working
even though we never changed anything in the file itself. We tested our code by
running ./timetrash script.sh which contained our test cases. It appeared from
the error message that make check was not creating the temp files correctly.
